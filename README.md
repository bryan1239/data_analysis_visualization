# 📊 Data Analysis and Visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **Pandas** for data analysis and **Matplotlib** (along with **Seaborn**) for data visualization. The dataset analyzed in this project is the classic **Iris dataset**, which contains measurements for different species of Iris flowers.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and clean a dataset using Pandas
- Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Create visualizations to understand patterns in the data

## 📂 Files Included
- `iris_analysis_visualization.ipynb` — Main Jupyter notebook with all code, analysis, and plots
- `README.md` — This file, describing the project
- `iris.csv` — If you're using a CSV version of the dataset

## 📈 Features
- Displayed the first few rows of the dataset
- Checked for missing values and data types
- Computed summary statistics
- Grouped data by species to find trends
- Created the following visualizations:
  - Line chart of sepal features over index
  - Bar chart of average petal length per species
  - Histogram of sepal length distribution
  - Scatter plot of sepal vs petal length, colored by species

## 🛠️ How to Run This Project

### ✅ Requirements
Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn notebook
